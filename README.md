# ETC5523 Assessment 1

This is a **sample** app for the ETC5523 Assessment 1. 

* The creator of this app is **Adarsh More**.
* The data used for this assessment is the `bird_counts` data which is obtained from 
  *"https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-18")"*. 

The goal of the app is to analyse the bird count and it's trend and to study if there is a
correlation between the hours spent on watching birds and count of birds.
